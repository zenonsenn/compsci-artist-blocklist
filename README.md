# compsci-artist-unblocklist

The extension:
https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist

This is a uBlacklist unblocklist that whitelists some AI/ML sites for educational purposes, notably huggingface. This may work best to those who are artists pursuing AI/ML in higher education/career (like me :P). We study AI for the math and statistics but also to make society better, not for generating AI slop. AI is just math y'all.

I use these blacklists:
- https://github.com/NotaInutilis/Super-SEO-Spam-Suppressor (for suppressing shady SEO tactics)
- https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist (for AI content sites)

I have only removed huggingface dot co because I do sometimes use it for searching datasets and models for my ML studies. I will update the blocklist if there are sites that are blacklisted but relevant for AI/ML studies.

If you have whitelist request(s), DM me on Twitter (X) or Bluesky @zenonsenn.
