# compsci-artist-blocklist

The extension:
https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist

In full honesty, I copy-pasted the blocklist from:
https://github.com/NotaInutilis/Super-SEO-Spam-Suppressor (for suppressing shady SEO tactics)
https://github.com/laylavish/uBlockOrigin-HUGE-AI-Blocklist (for AI content sites)

I have only removed huggingface dot co because I do sometimes use it for searching datasets and models for my ML studies. I will update the blocklist if there are sites that are blacklisted but relevant for AI/ML studies.

This is a uBlacklist blocklist that whitelists some AI/ML sites for educational purposes, notably huggingface. This may work best to those who are artists pursuing AI/ML in higher education/career (like me :P). We study AI for the math and statistics but also to make society better, not for generating AI slop. AI is just math y'all.

If you have site requests (or you want me to take this down), DM me on Twitter (X) or Bluesky @zenonsenn.
